Trigonometric Hyperbolic Theory

This repository introduces an original Trigonometric Hyperbolic Theory, developed to explore new relationships between classical trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions. The theory offers a fresh perspective on mathematical patterns, identities, and formulas that connect these two areas in ways that are not commonly documented.

The main goal of this theory is to simplify complex mathematical relationships and provide a systematic approach for analyzing problems involving both trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. It presents unique derivations, proofs, and examples that highlight underlying connections, making it easier for students, researchers, and math enthusiasts to understand and apply these concepts.

Included in this repository are detailed notes and illustrative examples that demonstrate the key principles of the theory. The content is designed for educational purposes, personal exploration, and potential research applications. By providing clear explanations and structured approaches, the repository encourages users to experiment, extend, and build upon the theory.

This project also aims to contribute to the wider mathematical community by presenting an original framework that inspires discussion, collaboration, and further investigation. Feedback and contributions are welcome, as they can help refine and expand the theory, making it more robust and applicable to diverse mathematical contexts.

Whether for learning, research, or curiosity, this repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and exploring the Trigonometric Hyperbolic Theory, providing a foundation for future studies and applications in mathematics.
