# Trigonometric Hyperbolic Theory — Notes

## Overview
This document contains initial notes for the Trigonometric Hyperbolic Theory developed in this repository. It explains the main ideas, definitions, and some key identities connecting trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.

## Definitions
- sin(x), cos(x) — standard trigonometric functions  
- sinh(x), cosh(x) — hyperbolic sine and cosine  
- Useful relation: cosh^2(x) - sinh^2(x) = 1

## Key identities / ideas
- Relationship attempts: (example forms)
  - Transformations between trigonometric and hyperbolic forms using complex arguments: sin(ix) = i sinh(x), cos(ix) = cosh(x)
  - Proposed framework: express mixed expressions f(sin, cos, sinh, cosh) in standardized bases to simplify analysis

## Examples
1. Example derivation 1 — converting sin and sinh combinations  
2. Example derivation 2 — solving a sample equation with mixed trig/hyperbolic terms

## Further work
- Add proofs for the main identities
- Provide illustrative plots and numeric examples
- Create a library of solved problems and exercises
